You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll offers support for math:
\begin{equation}
x = y
\end{equation}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

def print_hi(name):
  print(name)
{% endhighlight %}
