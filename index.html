            Hey there! If you are here, chances are that you are looking for some information about me. Well, you are in
            the right place. I was born in the 80s in a small town near Firenze, Italy. I studied
            statistics, computer science, and economics, and I researched information diffusion in first-class European
            and American universities. Today I lead a team of data scientists, solution architects, and software
            engineers to deploy state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning solutions. I always try to keep my
            team's morale high during challenging times and put my colleagues in the condition to express their full
            potential. I have a continuous learning mindset that brings me to explore novel innovation
            opportunities, learn new things, and undergo the most recent novelties in the broad field of artificial
            intelligence.
            <br><br>
            I like to solve complex problems. I like to understand how things work. I like science. I like the art. I like creativity. I like the opensource philosophy. I like remote work.
            <br><br>
            And I love my job because it's the best way I found to fully express myself.
