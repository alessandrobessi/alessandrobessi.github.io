    <span class="hello">
      Hi there!
    </span>
  </h1>

<p class="text-justify">
I'm an artificial intelligence consultant at Nextbit (Milan, ITALY), where I'm working together with a team of talented data scientists to deploy state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions across different industries. We code in R, Python, Scala. We work on distributed environments (Hadoop, Spark). We produce interactive dashboards and visualizations using RShiny and JavaScript.
<br><br>
In my previous life, I did research at Information Sciences Institute (Los Angeles, USA), a world leader in research and development of advanced information processing, computer and communications technologies. In particular, I worked on a IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency) project aimed at developing and testing new automated methods to forecast and detect cyber-attacks significantly earlier than existing methods. Moreover, I worked on a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) project aimed at modeling behavioral trajectories and incentives in gamified techno-social environments. Previously, I did research on the spreading of digital misinformation in online social networks at IMT Lucca.
<br><br>
During my short academic career I published 20+ papers in peer reviewed journals and conferences, including 2 PNAS, 4 Plos One, and 1 Nature Scientific Reports (you can find additional bibliographical information here: https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=47xtEeEAAAAJ&hl=en).
<br><br>
I also hold a Ph.D., but I don't mind being called "doctor".

<h4>Media Inquiries</h4>
I frequently respond to media requests for comments, expert opinion, or other analysis on data science and machine learning. Depending on my availability, I'm happy to discuss results, press releases, and hot off-the-presses papers.
