I carry AI research and development forward at Nextbit (Milan, ITALY), where I lead a team of data scientists and software engineers to deploy **state-of-the-art deep learning** and artificial intelligence solutions across different industries. 

We mainly code in Python leveraging deep learning frameworks such as **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. We deploy models and solutions on-premise, in the cloud (AWS or GCP), or both by providing tailor-made user interfaces calling models and core algorithms via API.

In my previous life, I did research at Information Sciences Institute (Los Angeles, USA), a world leader in research and development of advanced information processing, computer and communications technologies. In particular, I worked on a IARPA (**Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency**) project aimed at developing and testing new automated methods to forecast and detect cyber-attacks significantly earlier than existing methods. Moreover, I worked on a DARPA (**Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency**) project aimed at modeling behavioral trajectories and incentives in gamified techno-social environments. Previously, I did research on the spreading of digital misinformation in online social networks at IMT Lucca.

During my short academic career I published **20+ papers** in peer reviewed journals and conferences, including 2 PNAS, 4 Plos One, and 1 Nature Scientific Reports. You can find additional bibliographical information [here](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=47xtEeEAAAAJ&hl=en).
